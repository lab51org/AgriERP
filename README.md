## AgriERP - ERPNext module for Agriculture and Beekeeping for Italy
### What is this?
With this app you can manage fields, crops, fertilizers, operations, beekeeping and many other functionality through ERPNext (https://www.erpnext.org).

This is a module specifically written in order to abide to Italian laws and rules.
This Readme is also in english because I believe, besides some doctypes specific for Italy, that everything else can be forked or modified through specific branches for any other country.

### But you push commits once a month or less!
Yes, you are right, I am looking for someone that wish to be involved into this project, please let me know if you are interested :)

### Project priorities
1. Because at the moment I am alone, and I would use this app for my company in Italy i will focus on that part first
2. As soon I finish a part that can be stripped from all Italian law requirements, I will push it onto an international branch
